                    <strong>General Information </strong>
                    <p>Under Art 30 (1) of the constitution of India, and Art. (4) of the constitution of the Board of
                        Trustees, Shafi Muslim High School, Laheriasaral (Estd. 1933), a body duly registered with the Govt.
                        of Bihar under Societies Registration Act 1860, the Board resolved to sponsor a Teachers' Training
                        College dated 02.06.1982, to cater to the need of Teachers' Training from the session 1982-83, an
                        imperative need of the large number of untrained graduates of the region and to make them qualified
                        to seek employment as well as to provide opportunity in securing post-graduate degree in Education
                        and Research facilities with the passage of time.</p>
                    <p>Apart from this basic need of the untrained graduates and certificate holders, the Board also felt
                        the necessity of sponsoring a Teachers' Training College in this region which could produce human
                        resources, which could be safely entrusted with the responsibility of teaching the students in
                        Muslim Minority Institutions in anatmosphere conducive to the healthy growth of character of the
                        students in the light of the cultural, religious and linguistic heritage of the community so that
                        they may be able to discharge their national obligation with the imbued quality of heart, head and
                        character, making secular India richer and more glorious.</p>
                    <p>Further, the Board of Trustees recorded its deep appreciation of the decision of the Govt. of Bihar
                        to appoint one Urdu trained Teacher in every school of Bihar so that the goal of linguistic harmony
                        leading to national integration might be achieved. At the same time the Board recorded with deep
                        pains the dearth of Urdu trained teachers for which the posts either lay vacant or were being filled
                        up with the general teachers, having no knowledge of Urdu at all. Hence to fulfil the long-standing
                        necessity of the Muslim Community and of the population of the region, the Board of Trustees
                        sponsored and established a Teachers' Training College at Laheriasarai, Darbhanga, Bihar, as a
                        Minority Institution under Art. 30 (1) of the constitution of India with respect to its management.
